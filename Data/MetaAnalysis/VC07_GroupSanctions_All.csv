[This measure] distinguishes borrowers who encounter problems to repay their loans from borrowers who do not experience problems repaying their loans. We select this variable to measure the repayment problems of borrowers, because all borrowers in our sample have a clean portfolio, that is, they always manage to find a solution to repay their loans. This suggests that problems with loan repayment borrowers are faced with are due to cash flow management problems, instead of failing to make the necessary repayments.
